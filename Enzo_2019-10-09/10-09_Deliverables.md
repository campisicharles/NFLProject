- One-page cleaned summary.
- Data sources chosen.
- Project plan including
  - ETL to single data source
  - Visualization Tool (Tableau, D3, leaflet, etc?)
- You will need a professional Trial for Tableau to get DB access
- Every Group member should have some assigned tasks
- Drawings and flowcharts of the ETL dataflow and cleanup, and even Flowcharts or drawing of application (including such things as the Flask routes)
- Rough drawing of the presentation layer and what you want the visualization to conceptually look like or in Tableau what the story looks like
- What the ML (Machine Learning) model you are trying to use, or leaning toward?
  - Technology tools you are using (Jupyter Notebook, Zepl, Colab, etc).
- Github
  - Setup and ready to go.
- Suggestions:
  - After building the first model, look at the weights and try to reduce the number of features to get a similar result (less data in = easier).   This will probably be an iterative process; can you drop features and get similar results.
